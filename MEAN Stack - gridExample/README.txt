These are code samples designed to aggregate and display sale data in a grid using dynamic templates controlled through an angular directive. At the top level, the data is grouped hierarchically requiring a recursive template. At the second level, the data is grouped by node, product then sale type. The last level is breakdown of sales based on the selected criteria.

This is a good example of server-side data aggregation, DOM manipulation using a directive, use of nested ng-repeat and the use of promises and promise chaining on the client and server.
